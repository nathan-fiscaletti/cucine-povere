- 1/4 diced white onion
- 2 cups cooked chopped chicken
- 1 jar Prego Alfredo Sauce
- 1 can petite diced tomatoes

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these simple steps to create a delicious Chicken & Bacon Linguine Alfredo that will have your family coming back for seconds:

#### **Sauté the Onion**
Begin by heating a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add in 1/4 of a diced white onion. Cook the onion until it becomes soft and slightly browned, releasing a sweet, aromatic flavor that will be the base of your sauce.

#### **Add the Chicken**
Once the onion is nicely browned, it's time to add the star protein of this dish – chicken. Toss in your cooked, chopped chicken and stir it into the onions. Allow the chicken to heat through, absorbing some of the flavors from the onion.

> If you don't want to cook your own chicken, or don't have any left-over chicken, you can purchase small bags of pre-cooked and pre-seasoned chicken from your local grocery store.

#### **Pour in the Alfredo Sauce**
Next, pour in one jar of Prego Alfredo Sauce. This sauce will provide the creamy base that ties the whole dish together.

#### **Incorporate the Tomatoes**
To add a touch of brightness and tang, add in one can of petite diced tomatoes. The tomatoes will provide a subtle contrast to the richness of the Alfredo sauce.

#### **Season the Sauce**
Now, it's time to season your sauce to perfection. Sprinkle in some chopped parsley, along with pepper, garlic powder, and salt to taste. Stir everything together, then cover the pan and let it simmer on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together.

#### **Cook the Linguine**
While your sauce is simmering, bring a pot of water to a boil and cook 1 lb of linguine noodles according to the package instructions. Linguine is the perfect pasta for this dish, with its flat, wide shape that holds onto the creamy sauce.

#### **Combine the Pasta and Sauce**
Once the linguine is cooked, drain it well. Slowly add the linguine to the sauce, stirring as you go. This helps the pasta absorb the sauce evenly, ensuring every bite is full of flavor.

#### **Plate and Garnish**
Serve the Chicken & Bacon Linguine Alfredo on a plate, and top it off with a generous sprinkle of parmesan cheese, fresh chopped parsley, and, of course, crispy bacon bits. These toppings add the perfect finishing touch, making the dish look as good as it tastes.
