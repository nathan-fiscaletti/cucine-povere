### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Follow these simple steps to create a delicious Ground Beef & Tomato Mostaccioli that will have your family coming back for seconds:

#### **Sauté the Onion**
Start by heating 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add in 1/4 of a diced white onion and sauté until the onion softens and becomes translucent, releasing its natural sweetness.

#### **Cook the Ground Beef**
Next, add 1/2 pound of ground beef to the pan. Cook the beef, breaking it up as it browns. Once fully cooked, use a paper towel to absorb and dispose of the excess grease, leaving you with a flavorful and lean base for your sauce.

#### **Add the Tomatoes**
Pour in 1 can of crushed tomatoes, 1/2 can of petite diced tomatoes, and 1 can of tomato sauce. These three types of tomatoes create a rich and textured sauce that's full of vibrant flavors.

#### **Sweeten and Season the Sauce**
To balance the acidity of the tomatoes, add 2 tablespoons of sugar. Then, season the sauce with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, oregano, salt, pepper, and freshly chopped parsley. Stir well to combine all the ingredients, and let the sauce simmer on low heat. This allows the flavors to meld together, creating a sauce that's both rich and aromatic.

#### **Cook the Mostaccioli**
While the sauce is simmering, cook 1 pound of mostaccioli pasta according to the package instructions. Mostaccioli, with its tube-like shape, is perfect for holding onto the hearty sauce, ensuring every bite is full of flavor.

#### **Combine the Pasta and Sauce**
Once the mostaccioli is cooked and drained, slowly add it to the simmering sauce. Stir gently as you add the pasta to ensure it's evenly coated with the rich, savory sauce.

#### **Plate and Garnish**
Serve the Classic Beef Mostaccioli on a plate and garnish it with freshly chopped parsley, a generous sprinkle of parmesan cheese, and a small pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for a hint of heat. These final touches add freshness, richness, and a bit of spice, elevating the dish to perfection.
