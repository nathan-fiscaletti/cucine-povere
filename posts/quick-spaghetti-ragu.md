**Prep the Onion**

   Start by dicing up 1/4 of an onion and setting it aside. The onion will add a sweet, aromatic flavor to the sauce, forming the base of your dish.

**Saut√© the Onion**

   Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onion to the pan. Cook the onion until it becomes soft and slightly browned, releasing its natural sweetness and aroma.

**Cook the Ground Beef**

   Next, add 1 pound of ground beef to the pan with the softened onion. Season the beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Cook the beef, breaking it up into small pieces as it browns, ensuring it cooks evenly.

**Drain the Grease**

   Once the beef is fully cooked, use a paper towel to carefully remove any excess grease from the pan. This step helps to keep the sauce from becoming too oily, allowing the flavors to shine through.

**Add the Tomatoes**

   Pour in 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce. These ingredients will create a rich, hearty base for your sauce, full of tangy tomato flavor.

**Season the Sauce**

   Season the sauce with Italian seasoning, oregano, salt, pepper, sugar, and garlic powder to taste. Stir everything together to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. Let the sauce simmer on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together.

#### Preparing the Spaghetti

While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook 1 pound of thin spaghetti noodles according to the package instructions. Thin spaghetti is ideal for this dish, as it absorbs the sauce beautifully.

### Finishing Touches

**Combine and Serve**

   Once the spaghetti is cooked and drained, serve the beef and tomato sauce over the noodles. The sauce should generously coat the pasta, with plenty of beef in every bite.

**Garnish and Enjoy**

   To finish, garnish the spaghetti with freshly chopped parsley, a sprinkle of parmesan cheese, and a dash of crushed red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. These final touches add freshness, richness, and a slight kick to the dish.
